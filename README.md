Three methods for enhancing the spatial resolution of a three lead ECG (Lead I, Lead II and V3) using Simple RNN, GRU and LSTM
is given in the folder. The input is .mat file data which is preprocessed and is saved in the ../DNN/dataIn/ folder. The output
data will be stored in ../DNN/dataOutSimpleRNN16V3/, ../DNN/dataOutGRU16V3/ and ../DNN/dataOutLSTM16V3/ folders.
